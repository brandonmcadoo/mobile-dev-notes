# Mobile Development Notes

This is my personal knowledge base for learning **mobile app development**, with a primary focus on:

- Kotlin
- Android
- Modern mobile development patterns

These notes are written in Markdown and rendered as a documentation website using Docsify.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Keep all of my class notes in one place
- Use real code examples
- Build a long-term reference I can reuse in future projects and jobs

---

## How to Use This Site

Each section in the sidebar represents a major topic.  
Inside each topic are short, focused notes on specific concepts.

The structure is designed so that:
- Each file can be read in 5–10 minutes
- Code examples are copy/paste friendly
- Concepts build on each other

This is not meant to be a textbook — it’s meant to be a **practical developer reference**.

## Current Topics

### Kotlin
Core Kotlin language features.

- Basics (syntax, variables, control flow)
- Lambdas (functional programming style)
- Classes & OOP (constructors, properties, getters/setters)

### Android
(Android-specific topics will be added here)

### Projects
Notes and examples taken from real projects and assignments.

## Why This Exists

Instead of keeping notes in:
- Google Docs  
- Notion  
- Random files  

I’m keeping everything in:
- Plain Markdown
- Version controlled on GitHub
- Rendered as a real documentation site

This mirrors how professional engineering teams write internal documentation.

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for content
- Docsify for rendering
- GitHub Pages for hosting

No database.  
No backend.  
Just clean, fast documentation.
